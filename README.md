## Project Highlights

Key cleaning steps include:

- **Missing Data**: Addressed null values in critical columns like `Industry` and `Country`.
- **Duplicates**: Removed duplicate records for accurate analysis.
- **Outlier Detection**: Analyzed outliers in `Percentage` to ensure logical values.
- **Date Standardization**: Converted all date values to a uniform format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
